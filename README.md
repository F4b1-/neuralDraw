# neuralDraw
This is a gui for training and testing a digit detection system based on the neural network described in Tariq Rahid's book "Make your on neural network".

This repository includes the gui and the neural network. It does not include the mnint test data however. You can get it [here](http://www.pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv) and copy it to _mnist_dataset/mnist_train.csv_.
If you check the _Save in test data_ box, the result of your test will be added to _mnist_dataset/my_test_data.csv_. This data can later be used to improve your test data.
